				HOW IT WORKS</span>
			</h1>
			<p class="section-content">
				Premier Recruits is a confidential service that allows players to
				find a desired club privately through the use of an agent. This
				means that your name will remain confidential until you give us
				permission to pass it onto the club(s) you wish to talk to. <br />
				<br /> Premier Recruits takes the effort out of recruiting allowing
				teams to search for players for certain positions, salary and
				potential employment needs. Our agents actively engage with both
				players and clubs so unlike other recruiting sites where you find a
				name and then do the rest yourself, with Premier Recruits you've got
				an extra member on your recruiting team so that you already know the
				real key information including salary requirements.
